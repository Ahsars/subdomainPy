### Python scripts for Subdomain Modeling in ADCIRC+SWAN

Subdomain modeling is an exact reanalysis technique for ADCIRC+SWAN that enables the assessment of local *subdomain* changes with less computational effort than would be required by a complete resimulation of the full domain. 

So long as the subdomain is large enough to fully contain the altered hydrodynamics, multiple local changes may be simulated within it without the need to calculate new boundary conditions (Baugh et al., 2015).
